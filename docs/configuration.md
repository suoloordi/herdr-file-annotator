# Configuration

All configuration is optional — the defaults give a right-hand split pane
beside the agent with no review timeout.

Create `config.toml` in the plugin's config directory; find it with:

```sh
herdr plugin config-dir jonasbaeumer.file-annotator
```

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|-----|---------|---------|
| `placement` | `"split"` | `split` (beside the agent) or `tab` |
| `direction` | `"right"` | Split direction: `right` or `down` |
| `focus` | `true` | Move keyboard focus to the review pane when it opens |
| `accept_timeout_secs` | `20` | How long the agent waits for the pane to appear |
| `review_timeout_secs` | unset | If set, a review left open this long returns a `cancelled` verdict |
| `notify_on_verdict` | `true` | Nudge the agent (a short prompt typed into its pane) when a non-blocking review finishes with no `collect_review` waiting — see [MCP tools](mcp-tools.md#automatic-continuation-the-verdict-nudge) |
| `wrap_lines` | `false` | Start the pane with long lines wrapped to the pane width instead of clipped-and-pannable — `w` toggles it live either way, see [Controls](controls.md#diff-view) |
| `enabled_tools` | unset | Limit which review tools the agent can call; unset loads all tools by default — see [Enabled tools](#enabled-tools) below |
| `[keys]` | all defaults | Remap the pane's keybindings by action name — see [Custom keybindings](#custom-keybindings) below |

Example — open reviews as a tab, and auto-cancel anything left open for an
hour:

```toml
placement = "tab"
review_timeout_secs = 3600
```

## Enabled tools

All five review tools (`review_changes`, `show_changes`, `goto`, `focus`,
`collect_review`) are available to the agent by default. Set `enabled_tools`
to limit it to the ones you name:

```toml
enabled_tools = ["show_changes", "goto", "collect_review"]
```

A disabled tool is hidden from the agent and a direct call to one is
rejected. The list must contain only known tool names, with no duplicates —
anything else prints one warning and the full defaults apply, like every
other bad config value.

The config is read when the MCP server starts, so changes apply after
restarting your agent (or reconnecting its MCP servers — `/mcp` in Claude
Code). The exceptions are `wrap_lines` and `[keys]`: the review pane reads
them when it opens, so a change applies from the next review without a
restart.

## Custom keybindings

Every character key in the pane can be remapped in the `[keys]` table.
Name the action, give it a key:

```toml
[keys]
comment = "a"      # single visible character; case means shift ("G" ≠ "g")
approve = "ctrl+y" # or ctrl+<letter> (a-z; ctrl+i and ctrl+m are reserved)
wrap = "W"
```

A remapped action releases its default key. Actions live in a context —
the file list, the diff pane, or both — and two actions can share a key
only if their contexts never overlap. Any invalid entry (unknown action,
reserved key, collision) prints one warning and the pane falls back to
ALL default bindings, so a typo can never half-apply.

Deliberately not remappable, so the escape hatches keep working under any
config: `ctrl+c` (cancel, everywhere), `esc`, `enter`, `tab`, the arrow
keys and `pgup`/`pgdn` (fixed aliases of the movement and pan actions),
and everything typed while a comment or summary box is open. The `?`
overlay always shows your active bindings.

| Action | Default | Context | Does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `approve` | `a` | global | approve the review |
| `request_changes` | `r` | global | request changes (opens the summary box) |
| `cancel` | `q` | global | cancel the review |
| `help` | `?` | global | toggle the key-reference overlay |
| `toggle_files` | `b` | global | show / hide the file list |
| `zoom` | `z` | global | zoom the pane |
| `files_narrower` | `[` | global | shrink the file list |
| `files_wider` | `]` | global | widen the file list |
| `down` | `j` | global | move down |
| `up` | `k` | global | move up |
| `top` | `g` | global | jump to the first row |
| `bottom` | `G` | global | jump to the last row |
| `open` | `l` | files | open the file / toggle a folder |
| `half_page_down` | `d` | diff | half page down |
| `half_page_up` | `u` | diff | half page up |
| `next_hunk` | `n` | diff | next hunk |
| `prev_hunk` | `p` | diff | previous hunk |
| `pan_left` | `H` | diff | pan left |
| `pan_right` | `L` | diff | pan right |
| `pan_reset` | `0` | diff | reset the pan |
| `wrap` | `w` | diff | wrap long lines / back to clip-and-pan |
| `to_files` | `h` | diff | focus the file list |
| `select` | `v` | diff | start / clear a line selection |
| `comment` | `c` | diff | open the comment box |
| `delete_annotation` | `x` | diff | delete the annotation under the cursor |
| `toggle_view` | `t` | diff | toggle diff / source view |
