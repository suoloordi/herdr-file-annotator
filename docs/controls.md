# Controls

Everything in the review pane is keyboard-driven, with full mouse support as
an alternative. Press `?` (the default `help` binding) in the pane for the
context-aware key reference —
it shows exactly the keys that work in your current view. (While a comment
or summary box is open, `?` is typed as text like any other character; close
the box first.)

All character keys below are defaults: remap any of them with the `[keys]`
table in the config — see
[Custom keybindings](configuration.md#custom-keybindings). The `?` overlay
always reflects your active bindings.

## File list

Changed files show as a directory tree: folder rows (`▾ src/`) group the
files inside them, files show their name with the change counts. Moving
onto a file row previews it in the diff pane immediately; folder rows can
be collapsed and expanded without disturbing which file is open — a
collapsed folder shows how many changed files it's hiding (`▸ src/ (4)`).
An agent `goto` into a collapsed folder expands it automatically.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | move the cursor down / up the tree |
| `g` / `G` | jump to first / last row |
| `l` / `Enter` / `Tab` | on a file: focus the diff · on a folder: collapse / expand |

Mouse: wheel moves the cursor, click opens a file or toggles a folder.

## Diff view

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `j` / `k` | move the cursor line |
| `←` / `→` (or `H` / `L`) | pan long lines horizontally, `0` resets |
| `w` | wrap long lines to the pane width / back to clip-and-pan |
| `d` / `u` | half page down / up |
| `n` / `p` | next / previous hunk |
| `g` / `G` | jump to top / bottom |
| `h` / `Tab` | back to the file list |

Mouse: wheel scrolls, horizontal wheel pans, click places the cursor, drag
selects a range.

Long lines clip with `‹` / `…` markers at the edges; pan to see the rest,
or press `w` to wrap them to the pane width instead. Wrapped continuation
lines are indented behind the line-number gutter, so code columns stay
aligned and the cursor, annotations, and clicks keep addressing the whole
logical line. While wrapped, panning is inactive (both the keys and the
horizontal wheel) — `w` again returns to clip-and-pan. To start every review wrapped, set `wrap_lines = true` in
the [configuration](configuration.md).

## Annotating

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `v` | start a line-range selection (extend with `j` / `k`) |
| `c` | open the comment box for the selection (or the cursor line) |
| `Ctrl-T` | cycle the tag: none / `verify` / `fix` / `question` / `nit` |
| `Enter` | save the annotation (use `Alt+Enter` to insert a new line) |
| `Esc` | back out without saving |
| `c` on an annotated line | edit the existing annotation |
| `x` | delete the annotation under the cursor |

Mouse: drag over the lines, then press `c`.

Saved annotations appear inline, woven between the code lines, so you can
see your notes in place while you keep reading:

## Layout and views

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `b` | hide / show the file list column |
| `[` / `]` | shrink / widen the file list — more room for the code (side-by-side layout only; `0`-width isn't a thing, that's what `b` is for) |
| `z` | zoom the review pane full-screen (and back) |
| `t` | toggle diff view ↔ full source view of the file |
| `?` | key-reference overlay |

Mouse: drag the divider between the file list and the code to resize the
split directly (same clamps as `[` / `]`).

The `t` toggle is global: it switches the reading mode for the whole
review, so files you navigate to open in the same view. Reviewing the diff
is the default; the source view shows the finished state of the file with
no diff noise. Annotations work in both views.

## Folding (source view)

Long file, but only a few parts matter right now? Collapse the rest into
`⋯ N lines folded ⋯` pills — by hand with the keys below, or agent-driven:
during a guided walkthrough the agent can call its `focus` tool to fold a
file down to the regions it's explaining (see
[MCP tools](mcp-tools.md#focus-fold-a-file-to-what-matters)). Both kinds
share the same behavior, and folding only exists in source view — the diff
already shows just its hunks.

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `f` | fold the selection (`v` + movement first), or — with no selection — the indentation block under the cursor line: `f` on a `def`/`fn` header tucks the body away, the header stays visible |
| `Enter` (on a pill) | expand that fold |
| `F` | unfold everything in this file |

Mouse: clicking a pill expands it.

The block detection is indentation-based and language-agnostic (a
base-indent line opening with `)`, `]`, or `}` still belongs to the block,
so multi-line signatures fold correctly). It deliberately doesn't track any
language's real grammar — for a layout it doesn't recognize, such as a Rust
`where` clause at the header's own indent, select the lines yourself and
fold with `v` + `f`.

Pills are real cursor stops; movement skips the hidden lines. Very short
stretches (one or two lines) never fold — a pill would cost as much space
as it saves. Annotations hidden by a fold aren't lost: the pill shows a
note badge (`⋯ 24 lines folded · 1 note ⋯`), and expanding brings them
back inline. An agent `goto` into a folded stretch expands it
automatically, so you can never be pointed at something you can't see.

## Finishing the review

| Keys | Action |
|---|---|
| `a` | approve |
| `r` | request changes — opens a summary box first |
| `q` | cancel the review |
| `Esc` | clear an active selection; with nothing selected, **cancel the review** |
| `Ctrl-C` | cancel the review — works everywhere, even while typing in a box |

Cancelling is destructive: pending annotations are discarded and the agent
receives a plain `cancelled` verdict. `Esc` only cancels from the normal
browsing state — inside a comment or summary box it just closes the box (see
the annotate table above); `Ctrl-C` cancels from anywhere.

Annotations ride back to the agent on both `a` and `r` verdicts. Closing the
pane without a verdict surfaces to the agent as a normal `cancelled` result,
never an error or a hang.
